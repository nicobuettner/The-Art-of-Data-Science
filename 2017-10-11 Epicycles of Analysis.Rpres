Data analysis as a circular process
========================================================
incremental: true

- highly iterative
- non-linear
- information is learned at each step
- refine, redo, proceed to the next step
- What's differentiates data analysis from a study?
- no formal development or execution of a plan to collect data
- not formally deriving a hypothesis
- Asumption: data already exists

Visual representation
========================================================
incremental: true

***
1. Setting Expectations
2. Collecting information (data), comparing the data to your expectations, and if the expectations donâ€™t match
3. Revising your expectations or fixing the data so your data and your expectations match
4. Go through 1 to 3 iteratively at each of the following epicycles

Epicycles
========================================================
incremental: true

***
1. Stating and refining the question
2. Exploring the data
3. Building formal statistical models
4. Interpreting the results
5. Communicating the results

Tabular representation
========================================================

Example: Asthma prevalence in the U.S.
========================================================
incremental: true

- Is there already an answer to your question? --> refine
- How many people in the United States have asthma that is not currently controlled, and what are the demographic predictors of uncontrolled asthma?
- United States adult population, 18 years and older
- Does the number of rows in the data match the description in the codebook?
- Are your expectations about the age variable in line with your data?
- Model the data
- Interpret the results: age, African American/black race, body mass index, smoking status, low income, gender
- Communicate the findings: feedback, questions
